 2022-2023 Introduce Yourself !! 

Hi good day all, 

My name is Waisans and I am from asian countries. I had been a vegetarian since 30 years ago. Reasons of being vegetarian were contributing a small part to save our mother earth, not going to hurting any animals, do not wanna separating them from their family and wanna getting healthier. Getting good and mass protein will be quite challenging for vegetarian. For time being about 4 - 8 eggs daily for protein ingestion and so far so good. Besides eggs, I noted that there was new technology of 3D printing which can printing salmon filet which contain exactly 90% above of what real salmon nutrients has. This is really a very interesting and advancing. Wondering anyone here had try that ? What are the prices ? Looking forward if we can have forums which will chat and sharing about this technology's info.

Hi!! I'm excited to be part of this community! Almost 4 years vegan (vegetarian before) and am committed to building a movement that protects the animals and planet. I care a lot about whales, protecting the natural world, and ending animal agriculture as we know it. I consider myself global and cosmopolitan. Â 

I also love video games, reading, Indian food, soda, and anime.

Hi, I'm Michelle and I just joined. I've been vegan for 3 years now but I feel different from most vegans because I also try to be near zero-waste. That means I don't typically buy processed foods in packages. I'm equally upset by the ugliness of the animal agriculture industry as I am by the plastic industry and the sheer amount of waste that goes straight to landfills. We as a society need to change!!!

________

Hi! My name is Jennifer and my daughterâ€™s name is Melenda. We have just opened a vegan gourmet deli & market in Cocoa Village, FL. We have vegan meats & cheeses and lots of vegan other items. Everything is vegan so there is no need to read labels. Weâ€™ve read them for you! ðŸ˜Š 
We have been members on this app for several years and we are looking forward to getting to know more vegans on here and hopefully in person too!

Hi Everyone,

I'm Sofia and I love animals therefore am vegan. I would love to have a sanctuary one day so I can provide a happy life to rescues, and hoping one day we won't have any animals to rescue as we would all be vegan (one can dream, I know...). For now I try to spread the word, lead by example and introduce people I know to vegan food and living by having friendly conversations and meeting people where they are at in their journey to sustainability and empathy for animals. I found this website as I travel a lot personally and professionally and it is very helpful in finding vegan establishments. I'm based in Canada, and travel to Europe a lot (originally from Europe). I would be happy to connect wth likeminded people. 
Have a great day everyone!

OlÃ¡! I'm chef AmÃ©lio, from Brazil. I have a vegetarian/vegan restaurant in Shoreditch, London, England, called Oliveira Kitchen. I have been cooking professionally for 2 decades now. At first with Italian cuisine, as I am Italian descendent and spent sometime in Verona, Italy. Then I moved to French cuisine, worked with a few big names in the fine dining scene in London, from Michelin starred chefs to fine bistros.

But I wanted to do vegetarian cuisine, as I myself struggled to find a good place to eat when I turned vegetarian. 

My wife and I started our own restaurant in 2018. In 2020 we moved to a larger venue, where we are now. We struggled a bit because of Covid, but manage to just about survive. Not easy being an independent local restaurant without the big bucks to back you up, but we did well. We say our restaurant is vegetarian/vegan, but 95% of our menu is vegan. Our menu is based only on natural ingredients, all handmade in my kitchen. No fake meats, no ultra-processed junk. Just food. 

If you are interested in my work, have a look at our website. Anyone willing to connect to exchange ideas you are more than welcome. By the way, we would love to move to Vancouver, CanadÃ¡ or thereabouts. Just saying...

Hi, I had joined because we struggle to find places to eat when traveling. I knew Happy Cow had listings that were veg friendly and was going to help add to it. I didn't realize it doesn't accept new reviews if they aren't mostly or entirely vegan.

Hello!

Been vegan for about a year but started transitioning about 3 years ago. Not good at these introductions. ðŸ˜œ I love to cook and think I have come up with some amazingly creative vegan meals.

I run a Grocery and Gift giveaways group on fb and we have meet ups where I take vegans and those who are not quite there yet but want to be and show them how to read ingredient labels and what questions to ask when we are in even a coffee shop.

I think my goal is to make the world a better place and the group is how I plan to do that.

I live in Las Vegas, have no vegan friends yet... well... this is a cool site, looking forward to exploring more and having some invaluable resources.

Hi, we are veganced. We post vegan recipes and blogs :)

Hi everyone!;)

I'm new here but have begun to host Silent&Sensory Retreats. I'm a Vegan and believe we spend time being silent and maybe at first just observing our surroundings then eventually meditating will lead us all to our inner wisdom and truth. 

We all have this inner wisdom but life is noisy and busy and hinders our ability to hear and see the truth within. 

I would like to propose a time to be silent together at one of the most beautiful places here locally ^Bonita Springs "Shangri-la " 

I host 1-2 hour retreats and have plans to host up to 21 day retreats all geared towards optimum health. Working on our whole self. 

Please connect with me if you're interested and welcome your thoughts. 

All donations of you choose will 100% go towards the development of a Ranch and permanent home solution for Orphans and animal Rescue. 

You can read more about it all at https://www.heart2helpclub.org/ 

With Love & Light!;)

Hi,

Just joined today :O). I'm looking to meet like minds here who share similar interests and would love to engage in respectful, positive discussions where we might learn from each other. I've been vegan for about a year now. Before that, I was vegetarian for a decade. Reading the book, the Future of Nutrition, by Dr. Colin Campbell which I highly recommend put paid to that virtually overnight.

I've begun the process of transitioning all of my clothes and shoes to vegan as well and I'm excited by the prospects of making this happen!

For the past dozen years, I've worked in the African social enterprise sector, supporting startups and nonprofits working primarily in the food and agricultural industry. And I'm in the process of finding my next adventure! 

I look forward to connecting with and getting to know as many of you as I can!

Thanks.

Hi, my name is Scott. I am an Emergency Manager, Social Worker and a Risk Consultant. Married with adult and teenage children in Australia. Vegetarian since 1975, Vegan since 2009. I have participated in the growing momentum toward vegetarian and vegan lifestyle, enjoying the increasing options over these decades. Traveling extensively I have enjoyed the international and Australian increase in options available and the better quality and variety. From the days when there was one vegetarian restaurant in Sydney Australia and restaurant options were often lettuce with tomato, we have come a very long way. I used to wander streets in foreign places looking for a restaurant or cafe with vegetarian options until the Happy Cow app provided a convenient method of quickly locating a suitable venue wherever I travel. I love the ability of being able to read and write reviews, take photos and contribute. The occasional poor standards and cross contamination can be noted to share with others. Happy Cow is indispensable in an increasingly vegan world. Â

Hi!!

Hi everyone. I am from Santa Monica, California - the same city as HappyCow founder Eric. I've been vegan since 1986 - long before it was considered the 'cool thing' it is today, and vegetarian since 1983. Back in those early days, there were far fewer vegan options available! Even in the LA area, there were less than a handful of vegan-only restaurants (Kingsley Garden in LA, the ComeBack Inn in Venice and Orean's Burger on Vine in Hollywood). At home I made my own veggie burgers by hand, grinding vegetables and other ingredients in a food processor. 

How things have changed!

In late 1988 I read and was very inspired by the book Diet for a New America by John Robbins, that connected a vegan diet to all kinds of environmental, animal cruelty and personal health issues. During that same time I first got involved in Green Party politics, which I continue to this day. The integrative analysis in Diet for New America was exactly what I felt formed the basis of green politics, which we developed in real time in the 1980s. In April 1990 I helped organize a public forum hosted by the local Green Party with John Robbins, that drew over 350 people to the old Retail Clerks Union Hall in Santa Monica. During that time I also interviewed John on Pacifica Radio Station KPFK Los Angeles on a show that I hosted then called 'Green Perspectivesâ€™.

In 1996 I was elected to the seven-member Santa Monica City Council and served there for eight years. Before the meetings, the City would purchase dinner in bulk for all the council members, so we could go right to City Hall for the meetings and not have to go home to eat first. In 1998 a vegetarian was also elected to the council (also a Green Party member, we had two Greens and five Democrats). What we found with the dinners is that the other council members always wanted to eat the vegetarian and vegan food, instead of what was ordered for them!

In the early 2000s when Bubba Gump Shrimp Company was going to open a restaurant on public property on the Santa Monica Pier, I successfully worked with local authorities to require that the restaurant offer a separate vegan menu, under the argument that this was prime public property and it needed to be open and accommodating to people with vegan dietary preferences, because that would be reflective of the dietary demographics of the region. 

Regarding HappyCow, I can not stress how helpful it has been for me. I am fortunate to be a world traveler (50 counties and counting!) and I use HappyCow everywhere I go around the world. I also contribute reviews with photos about many of the restaurants on Happy Cow that I visit, and also send word to HappyCow of many restaurants not previously listed on HappyCow, and then write reviews about them once their listings have become published. In the interest of â€˜paying backâ€™ for the great services HappyCow offers to people like me, I have also contributed a modest amount financially in the past to HappyCow and will do so again in the future. I also consider traveling with HappyCow and posting about and supporting vegan/vegetarian restaurants (and those friendly to us) to be a form of activism to support the vegan and animal rights movements, which is a nice way of integrating means and ends in my life.

Nice to meet you all this way. Maybe weâ€™ll run into each other some day at a restaurant listed on HappyCow somewhere around the world!

Hello, we're Kelly & Dusty and we've been vegan for 7 years. We love finding new restaurants with vegan options when we travel. Went WFPB for health, then it turned into also being for the animals and our planet. We eat vegan when we're not at home but eat WFPB with no oil at home. 
We're located in Minnesota- love to road trip and write about our travels on our blog

Hi everyone! I'm Crystal, me and my hubby are mostly vegetarian, a couple of years ago we tried to go full vegan but unfortunately we couldn't make it so we go back to most veg. We had (and still have) a healthy diet so we didn't take it as a step back but a "maybe we weren't ready or is definitely not for us", so at the end it didn't affect our spirits. Because our heritage, we have many latinamerican influences in our meals and so many people get surprised when we serve vegetarian/mostly vegetarian dinners hehe. I'm from the Maritimes (New Brunswick), I do some belly dancing as a hobby and like to crochet specially in winter time.

Thank you very much for letting me be part of your community!

Hi. I'm Bambys Buddy,and and have been a member for one day and working on being a vegan for about three weeks. I am handicapped and older than sin. (In my 80s) Also have fibromyalgia and am home bound.. I am searching for easy, quick and simple recipes and meal plans. One of my Daughter is an MD and is backed up by my hubby's doctor with the belief that being vegan at my age can damage my liver etc. It will be better than the TV dinners we eat, or crackers and cheese, if nothing else is available.

One daughter, who works long hours after losing her husband to a heart attack at a young age, will make me a vegan meal a week. My MD daughter (not working but spending lots of time helping all the older members of her church, says she doesn't want to make two meals even once a week, one for her small family and one for us.. She sometimes send over a meal of leftovers to eat that I can't touch because they are spicy and I have to get my stomach back into shape. My hubby eats them. He said he will try help me, though he has had his own struggles with aging.. He doesn't eat vegan, but will help me.
I'm typing up recipes to help us (quick and easy.) I can't stand long (Fibromyalgia and other stuff) but can do some using my walker, and sit in my wheel chair to rest for awhile and then do more. Am determined to make this work. We have been existing on TV meals and snack foods like crackers and cheese. I guess my MD doc daughter thinks that's more healthy! Will not be as active in the group as I would like since I have to type up meal plans and recipes and learn to cook again after 10 years of eating slop,, but am really happy to have found this group!
Any simple and quick nutritious meals of meal plans would be most appreciated!

Hi, I'm Abi. 
Recently relocated from South Africa to the Washington DC area with my husband. 

I'm not permitted to work because of my spousal visa restrictions, so to keep myself from becoming a lump of vegan lard, I'm creating videos about our adventures (vegan and otherwise) in the USA. 

>>> I'd REALLY love some recommendations of vegan places we should visit and film!

Greetings cowmunity,

Thank you to Eric and the Happy Cow team and community for making this app a very well cherished and necessary item for happy plant based global travelers on and off well traveled routes. 

My Happy Cow story began with my vegetarian journey in High School inspired by very smart nature girl older sister and a vegan friend who gave me a great book "Survival into the 21st Century" 

Many stories and high anxiety type altitude travels later, I had veered off and over the plant based path and took off on a long and very interesting career as an international Flight Attendant.

In 1992, after a very exhausting, tear jerkingly traumatic experience during the deregulation of U.S. airlines that took a brutal and heavy hit on airlines workers, I went back to a vegetarian diet for health then transitioned to vegan in the following decade. 

BHC (Before Happy Cow) I can recall hours of wandering around the planet being the only vegetarian on the inflight crew, usually dining solo, looking at countless restaurant menus ( where the only veggie options were french fries & iceberg lettuce salad) and hauling travel books and many maps around to find healthy options. 

Now after a very interesting 33 year international flight attendant career that supported my combined media art practice enabling me to move to Manhattan and complete MFA studies,

I am currently retired, residing and working on my ever expanding combined media art practice in Hudson Yards Hell's Kitchen in Midtown West Manhattan along with advocacy for wellness focused environmentally friendly practice and sustainable plant based outreach. 

I'm currently looking forward to meeting more kindred spirits involved in plant based advocacy
and environmentalism for a new cooperative combined media studio that will facilitate collaborations for sustainable solutions for our planet and all of the wonderful creatures we share it with. 

Happy to be located just a hop, skip and jump away from Javits Center, NYC where the Plant Base Expo is happening this week - September, 2022. Please reach out and shake a limb! 

Please see more info on my combined media projects and explorations at Artssummit.com, IG Artssummit, TWTR Artssummit_MMC, FB Margaret McInroe Arts Summit.

At Nellys Delhi, we have always tried to push boundaries and have now made it into a reality, mouthwatering Indian street food using all vegan, vegetarian products.


Thanks,

Hello, bit of an odd person here. Albeit in a much more vegetarian focused diet, I am still not fully vegan but instead mostly pescatarian. I love to talk about anything from vegan/vegetarian cooking to literature. Mostly joined to help educate the vegan and other plant based communities on health issues we may face more than others, especially in terms of nutrition.

Hello I'm Trailer Tarot! I also go by Dirty Doves. I am a painter and photographer. I am learning digital art. I joined this forum to raise awareness about exploitative non-profits. You can read about it here. And donate if you can but it's not necessary. https://gofund.me/a97fa457 People will harm others and exploit animals for profit. We can't force them to behave. But we can use the same tactics to fight back - in a Batman pirate sort of way. Â  ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡² Nice meeting you.

Hello everyone, I'm Reda. I am an enthusiast of vegan food. I also write blogs on https://passkart.com/ where we can further connect.

When I was 15 years young I decided that I shall never eat dead animals again because we as humans don't have the right to kill animals for food. About 12 years ago I finely got it. It's not only about eating animals, it's about exploiting animals. I became vegan that same day. Living vegan as well as explain and inform non-vegans all about veganism and animal abuse is a very important part of my life. I really feel sick and sad when I think about what humans are doing to animals.

My name is Monique and I am a 60 years old granny. I live in Heerenveen, in The Netherlands. Iâ€™m very happy with this app, especially while traveling.

Hi! KaCee here - joined a while back but just now getting here to learn more! I have been slowly getting meat out of my diet for 3-4 years now, and I am stuck. I need to learn more about food and what vitamins I am missing and new foods to cook!!! Living in Indiana we have limits on local produce.

Hi - my partner "meekk" and I run Sonoma Wine Shop & La Bodega in Sebastopol, CA. I've had Sonoma Wine Shop for 22 years, and run a wine club that provides hand picked wines to each of our members. We created La Bodega as a 100% vegetarian pasta and cheese shop 14 years ago. Later we expanded to Sebastopol and served mixed foods, and have recently changed our menu back to 100% vegetarian and vegan. We changed in part because we feel the planet is at risk, and we all need to do something to help the situation. We have 2 chefs and 2 cooks and produce stellar food. Their backgrounds include formal Parisian chef training, Italian, Middle Eastern, Peruvian, Mexican & classical German and Austrian desserts.

We are getting more visits now from vegetarians and vegans at La Bodega and getting very nice comments and support. We are also strongly appealing outwards to flexitarians by creating some dishes using 'plant based' vegan ingredients like 'Black Sheep Lamb', and 'Beyond Beef'. Our vegetarian cesar salad is fantastic. We have Hodo Yuba from Oakland, that we use to make a vegan and gluten free roulade. We buy local and many organic ingredients, sourcing from Petaluma, CA for eggs and flour. We use local California cheeses, especially Fiscalini and Clover, Redwood Hill Farm goat yoghurt to make our own in-house labne, Tomales Bay and Vella.

We produce our own wine, Harvest View Wine, that I help make with 2 women winemakers and some assistance from my partner meekk. We also buy wine directly from family-owned wineries and vineyards from Sonoma, Mendocino and Napa Valley. 

Like many small biz, we have struggled through fires, floods, pandemic, and a lot of aggravating politics. We believe in our community and that social hospitality is a way to build & strengthen community and remember our shared humanity.

Personally, meekk and I live in Sebastopol, CA and raise miniature horses. 5 of 6 were born on my mini-ranch. I am involved in different political issues, including a little Sonoma County politics. I am about 90% vegetarian/vegan, the rest flexitarian - my partner meekk is 110% vegetarian/vegan.

We wish everyone a healthy and happy 2022, and hope you'll visit us in Sebastopol.

Hello everyone!

My name is Debbie and I`m from the Netherlands. Together with my husband (who is mostly veg but nevertheless very supportiveðŸ˜‰) we love to discover and come back to veg(an) restaurants. Whether it`s where we live or on our travels. I started to replace meat products about 10 years ago and since then have slowly but surely adjusted to a plant based lifestyle. For me the Deliciously Ella (debut) cookbook in 2015 rocked my world and taught me so much about cooking plant based recipes. Nowadays its becoming easier to find vega(n) options in supermarkets and restaurants so I feel like its finally being accepted as a healthier form of looking at food.

I just signed up here but I would love to help and learn from each other here on Happy cow!

Hello all! Whole Food Plant-Based lifestyle over here. Just started to add to the Happy Cow community by adding photos, reviews, listings, so on. Restaurant owners are so HAPPY to talk about current offerings and thoughts of future vegan offerings! Did you know that the vegan lifestyle has grown over 5% in the past year? We are starting to see SO MANY new vegan product lines and markets emerging! I'm sorry, I'm sure you all already know this, I just get so excited. I'm only a silver member right now but I'm thinking about becoming an Ambassador as my area has some veg-option locales that aren't listed yet and I would love to be a major part of what is happening here. I look forward to helping vegans and veggies and WFPB's eat better when travelling or eating out. Thank you for reading my ramble.

WFPB Vegan Las Vegan proud to be part of this truly global community that is HappyCow! In that sense, it must be the largest membership organization for veganism and plant-based living? I view veganism and carnism as opposite ends of a spectrum, with reducetarians (flexitarians) occupying the middle ground. As much as we use the term, "veganism," to describe our way of life, I believe we should use the term, "carnism," to describe the opposite way of life. Otherwise, we continue to let carnists off the hook by allowing their belief system to remain invisible (as Melanie Joy points out). I prefer the the term, "reducetarian," to the term, "flexitarian," because the former is inclusive of vegans and vegetarians (as Brian Kateman points out). Therefore, I advocate uniting on the common ground of reducetarianism for strength in numbers. On a final note, the term, "vegan," as an adjective, refers to what foods are excluded from consumption, whereas, the term, "whole food, plant-based," refers to what foods are included in a healthy diet. Hence, I use both terms in everyday life.

Hi everyone! Weâ€™re Dan and Em and weâ€™ve been vegan for over 6 years now, and have relied on Happy Cow for almost as long to find the best vegan places to eat whilst living in London.

Hi All,

Iâ€™m super proud to be part of this community- Iâ€™ve been vegan 12+ years and itâ€™s been rad! Iâ€™m also super encouraged by everyone interested in eating a more plant-based diet! Although my road to veganism was overnight, Iâ€™m here to be a cheerleader for others that may be starting out (baby steps). 

Also, I know I could use being a more whole foods vegan - but MY golly do I enjoy my vegan food junk! We are so fortunate! If youâ€™re in Nor*Cal donâ€™t be shy to connect! Saludos!
